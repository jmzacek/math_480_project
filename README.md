###Chaos Week Scheduling

###To Do:

* Pass through documents for clarification and typos
* Do we need to present objective function and constraints in mathematical terms?
* Are we consistent with all terms?
 * Chaos Week vs. Week of Chaos vs. "Chaos Week" vs. "Week of Chaos"
 * IP vs. LP
 * MathILy vs. MathILy-Er

###Notes:
* I took the liberty of changing MathILy-Er to MathILy. I don't think we need to be that specific and I think it's more confusing in its full form.
* I am unable to recreate the sub-optimal solution for 2015 that closely resembles Jonah's schedule.
 * Even with inefficient solver parameters, I am getting the better solution which diverges from Jonah's schedule.
 * Do we need to reword the section that references this? Or will we add this later?
* If you change indentation or linespacing within github's editor
 * Use "\indent" for indentation
 * Use "\\" at the end of a paragraph for a new line
