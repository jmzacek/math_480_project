## math_480_project
###Project for Prof. Billey's Math 480 Spring 2016 class
###Chaos Week Scheduling

###To Do:

* Pass through documents for clarification and typos
* Do we need to present objective function and constraints in mathematical terms?

###Notes:
* I took the liberty of changing MathILy-Er to MathILy. I don't think we need to be that specific and I think it's more confusing in its full form.
* I am unable to recreate the sub-optimal solution for 2015 that closely resembles Jonah's schedule.
 * Even with inefficient solver parameters, I am getting the better solution which diverges from Jonah's schedule.
 * Do we need to reword the section that references this? Or will we add this later?
